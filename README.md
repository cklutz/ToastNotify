# ToastNotify
CLI tool to produce Windows Toast Notifications

This tool is ment to be called from scripts or other applications that for some reason cannot directly
interact with the required APIs to produce a Toast Notification.

It is currently rather lacking, in that you can only produce simple toasts with a header, message
and optionally an image.
